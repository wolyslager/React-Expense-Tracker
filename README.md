## Summary
Building this project using React was fun. Since I had already built a similar project using vanila JS, it was interesting to see how much easier it is to control the flow of information or "state" of the application using this framework. It was also interesting to see how easy it is to add and delete expenses when taking advantage of the reusability of components in React.
